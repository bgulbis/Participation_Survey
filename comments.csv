19,1,"No perceived benefit to our practice, the department, and MH"
19,3,Increased outreach and engagement of all preceptors in the residency program. More one on one or service line based meetings between residency leadership and preceptor(s) to develop presentation and research ideas
18,1,"1. Ability to extract reliable data independently. 2. Statistics - understanding statistical applications, access to SPSS and knowing how to use it."
13,1,Availability to obtain patient list and data for the resident.
10,1,lack of department computer support for data management
9,1,"I think the biggest problem for the residency program is the research subcommittee. Here are the problems: Lack of effective mentorship; Lacks the focus on what the clear goal are for the residents research program; Lacks intellectual discussion; I recommend adding more experienced person, such as Judith Smith or even considering outside member of health care ( physicians) with research background"
7,2,It would be helpful if: 1. Reminder emails with attached articles went out earlier to facilitate reading articles 2. The reminder emails contained calendar invitations so the presentations show up in my schedule
6,3,"Making sure ideas are feasible/inline with RPD expectations prior to the resident's choosing the activity topic/preceptor - maybe a group brainstorming session or examples of past topics for that activity to make expectation known. If possible, decrease student/ resident rotations when working on a time-consuming activity like a resident research project."
5,2,Work load is too great and competing projects
5,3,"Less stringent criteria, better transparency and expectation from the research committee. The PI of the research should reserve the right and final saying on the project and committee should refrain from setting final approval."
4,2,"Generally it is an issue of time. I can't attend journal clubs, all presentations, precept rotations, and precept research without sometime to do actual work (patient care, mpps, quality work, etc)."
3,1,Obtaining data is difficult (pt lists)
1,1,too many steps and people involved in residency research projects
1,2,not focused to clinical areas
1,3,increase acceptance of ideas
